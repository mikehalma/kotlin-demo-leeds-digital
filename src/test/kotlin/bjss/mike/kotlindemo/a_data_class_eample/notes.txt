Other features of @Data
- Lombok also allows to change accessors (private, package-private etc.)
- Lombok respects non final and @NonNull properties
- The constructor can be replaced with a static factory method
- Can add @Accessors(fluent = true) to switch to fluent accessors (removes get)

Cons
- no equivalent to copy is available in Lombok
- can be hard to debug without the relevant tooling

Demo
- remove final to see how the required args constructor is changed
- add @Getter(AccessLevel.PRIVATE) to show how to set accessor level
- add @Accessors(fluent = true) to the class to show fluent getters
